# Notes & Learnings

This folder contains written notes from my learning process while
building core programming concepts.

These notes focus on:
- Common mistakes I made and how I fixed them
- Conceptual confusions and clarifications
- Small insights that improved my problem-solving approach

## How these notes are used
Before writing or revisiting code, I refer to these notes to avoid
repeating the same mistakes and to improve clarity in logic.

## Philosophy
Understanding why something works is more important than
memorizing syntax. These notes document that understanding.

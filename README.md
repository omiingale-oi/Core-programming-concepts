# Core-programming-concepts
Building strong Python fundamentals and problem-solving skills.

This repository focuses on building strong programming fundamentals
and clear problem-solving skills.

I created this repo to strengthen core concepts that are often skipped,
such as logic building, clean code, and understanding how things work
under the hood.

## What this repository contains
- Core programming concepts with simple examples
- Logical problem-solving using Python
- Notes on mistakes, edge cases, and learnings

## Why this matters
Strong fundamentals make learning any language or framework easier.
This repository reflects consistent learning and improvement.

## Current focus
